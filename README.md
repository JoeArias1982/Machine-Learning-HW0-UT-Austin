 Load the Wisconsin breast cancer data set, which is available as part of the sklearn datasets. You can read more about this dataset here.
The questions below involve exploring the data by plotting some figures, and you will find libraries like numpy, matplotlib and seaborn very useful. You may want to read up on built in functions like where from numpy for finding indices (or index from pandas) and show, savefig from matplotlib to show and save your plots.
(a) How many rows and columns are there in this data set? What do the rows and columns represent?
(b) How many malignant cases are there in total?
(c) Make a scatterplot of ‘mean compactness’ and ‘mean perimeter’. Try to color the points by their label (i.e. malignant or benign). You may find scatter (from matplotlib) or jointplot (from seaborn) useful for this.
(d) Make pairwise scatterplots of ‘mean texture’, ‘mean perimeter’, ‘mean compactness’, and ‘mean radius’. You may find scatter matrix (from matplotlib) or pairplot (from seaborn) useful for this. Do you notice that two of these features seem to be particularly correlated? Why might this be?
